/*Overlapping subproblem property
someimes like in fibonacci same fib for a number is calculated again to avoid this we'll use :
Techniques of Dynamic Programmin:
1. Memoization-top-down (save value caluclated for the first time in memory and then lookup fir it if encountered again)we maintain lookup table to store aldready solved soltuion
2. Tabulation(save values in tables and lookup table)

Dynamic Programming is used if problem foloows
1. Optimal Substructure Property
2. Overlapping Sub Problem*/

/*Fib Program by memoization*/
